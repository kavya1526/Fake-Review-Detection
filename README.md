## Introduction
The project focuses on identifying and predicting fake reviews, which is a significant issue for online platforms. The approach combines multiple machine learning and deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy and robustness in predictions.

## Data Collection
Data is collected from various sources including Yelp and Amazon. The datasets contain reviews, ratings, and other relevant metadata.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves cleaning the datasets, handling missing values, and normalizing the text reviews. This step is crucial to ensure the quality of the input data for model training.

## Feature Extraction
Feature extraction techniques are employed to convert textual data into numerical representations. Common methods used include TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and BERT embeddings.

## Model Training
Several machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines are trained. Additionally, deep learning models like LSTM and BERT are also utilized to capture complex patterns in the data.

## Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation and grid search techniques are used to fine-tune the hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of combining machine learning and deep learning techniques for predicting fake reviews. The results indicate significant improvements in accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods.
